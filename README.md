Ducktor is a quack medicine mod created for ModFest: Carnival. It adds various sources of the new Rejuvenation status effect, which applies the
regeneration heart bounce effect but instead *prevents* all healing from taking place. Rejuvenation potions are brewed from a Magnificent potion,
comprised of a water bottle and a warped fungus, and sweet berries. Lozenges are crafted from sweet berries, sugar, and a honey bottle, and give
the rejuvenation effect when eaten. Scented candles are crafted from string, honeycomb, and amethyst shards, and occasionally spawn lingering
clouds of rejuvenation around them. Lastly are warding candles, which are crafted the same as scented candles but with gunpowder instead of
amethyst, and occasionally generate a small, non-damaging explosion.

The lozenge texture is from [RPG Items - Retro Pack by blodyavenger](https://blodyavenger.itch.io/rpg-items-retro-pack), the candle textures were
drawn by BluKat, and the duck in the icon was drawn by wishi.
